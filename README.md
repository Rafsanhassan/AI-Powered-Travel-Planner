  - Flexible date parsing (e.g., "next summer")
  - Personalized suggestions (e.g., hidden gems, cultural highlights)

## 📦 Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ai-travel-planner.git
cd ai-travel-planner
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Users input trip details (or describe them in natural language)
2. The system extracts/refines preferences (dates, destination, interests, etc.)
3. A dynamic travel prompt is generated and sent to Falcon 7B via Hugging Face Inference API
4. The generated itinerary is displayed in a structured, readable format
